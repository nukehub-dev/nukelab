# Changelog

All notable changes to the NukeLab platform are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Releases are cut with `scripts/bump-version.sh X.Y.Z`, which stamps the
`[Unreleased]` section below and syncs the version across `VERSION`,
`backend/app/version.py`, and `frontend/package.json`. Git tags (`vX.Y.Z`)
are the release source of truth; CI builds container images tagged with the
release version.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Pull-based production deploys: pin `NUKELAB_VERSION` or `NUKELAB_IMAGE_TAG`
  to switch `nukelabctl up` / `update` from source builds to pulling tagged
  `ghcr.io/nukehub-dev/nukelab-backend` and `-frontend` images. The three
  backend services share one backend image; `update --build` forces a source
  rebuild even in pull mode. Unpinned deploys keep today's source-build
  behavior.
- Release versioning: git tags (`vX.Y.Z`) are the single source of truth.
  `scripts/bump-version.sh` syncs the version across `VERSION`,
  `backend/app/version.py`, `frontend/package.json`, and this changelog.
- Dynamic version injection: CI image builds pass the resolved tag as the
  `APP_VERSION` build arg (`backend/Dockerfile`), so running containers
  report the exact image tag (`2.1.0`, `main`, `pr-42`). The API root,
  `/health/status`, and the OpenTelemetry service version resolve via
  `settings.app_version`; empty or unset `APP_VERSION` falls back to the
  static literal in `app/version.py`.
- Compose builds bake the platform version into locally built backend images:
  `nukelabctl` exports `NUKELAB_VERSION` (from the `VERSION` file / git tag,
  overridable via the env file) and `compose.yml` passes it as the
  `APP_VERSION` build arg to the backend and celery images, so stacks
  deployed with `nukelabctl` report the checkout version instead of
  `0.0.0-dev`.

### Changed

- Backend version string is no longer hardcoded: `app/main.py`,
  `app/api/health.py`, and the OpenTelemetry service version in
  `app/config.py` all resolve through `settings.app_version` (env-first,
  static fallback in `app/version.py`).
- The static fallback in `app/version.py` is now the fixed sentinel
  `0.0.0-dev` instead of a release-looking literal — a version that can
  never be mistaken for a release, and which `bump-version.sh` no longer
  touches (only `VERSION`, `frontend/package.json` + lockfile, and this
  changelog are bumped at release time).
- `frontend/package.json` version set from `0.0.0` placeholder to the
  platform version.

## [2.0.0]

The 2.0 platform was delivered phase-by-phase without git tags. See
[docs/plan/IMPLEMENTATION-PHASES.md](docs/plan/IMPLEMENTATION-PHASES.md)
for the full delivery record and [docs/plan/ROADMAP.md](docs/plan/ROADMAP.md)
for recent milestones.
